# NanoDocs Discord BOT 

Discord bot written in Python - Pulls info from https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/

## How to use

The info can  be called using either a command or sending a link. 

See examples below: 

```bash
#rpc account_info

https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/#account_info

Both will return the description & other important info related to that section of the website.
